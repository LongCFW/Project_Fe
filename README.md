This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.0.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To clone and run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LongCFW/Project_Fe.git


📁 You can clone it into any folder, for example:
D:\test>git clone https://github.com/LongCFW/Project_Fe.git



2. Navigate into the project folder
cd Project_Fe


3. Install dependencies
npm install


4. Start the development server
ng serve -o


You can also use ng serve if you don't want the browser to open automatically.

Once the server is running, open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:4200/


The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

🛠️ Code Scaffolding
Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:
ng generate component component-name


For a complete list of available schematics (such as components, directives, or pipes), run:
ng generate --help



📦 Building
To build the project, run:
ng build


This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the dist/ directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

🧪 Running Unit Tests
To execute unit tests with the Karma test runner, use:
ng test



🧭 Running End-to-End Tests
For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:
ng e2e


Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
